# Ion Compiler

Welcome to the Ion compiler's source code repository! This compiler is special as it's bootstrapped - it's written in Ion itself.
The purpose of this project is to provide a self-hosting compiler for the Ion programming language, which showcases the modern syntax and design of the Ion language while staying close to the metal like C.

## Features

- **Modernized Syntax**: Inspired by C but designed for the modern era.
- **Order Independent Declarations**: Free yourself from the restrictions of order.
- **No Header Files**: Ion introduces a modular package system.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Because flexibility matters.
- ... and more to come!

## Building the Compiler

First, ensure you have the prerequisites installed:

- og ion compiler from here: https://github.com/ion-language/bitwise-ion
- gcc

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the repository directory
- Build the compiler with `ion main`
- Build the c output that you got from the previous step with gcc
